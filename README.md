# Tourism Platform Concept
This SPA project was implemented for a travel company. The project consists of an administrative part, a moderator part and a client part. The main page contains main tours of Kyrgyzstan, you can click on the tour and go to the detailed view, where you will find a complete information (Google map of the tour, route, price and booking form). Also, from the main page you can go to the pages: About us, All tours, News, Contact us and to the Registration and Login pages. Administrator can delete, edit and add information on the site, and can also change the role model. At the same time, the moderator accepts and processes applications for tours (Drag and Drop on pure JS). The project can be adapted for tours around the whole Central Asia (Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan).
